<div class="content">
  <p>When a player moves a piece to a square on which it attacks the enemy king—that is, a square from which it could capture the king 
    if the king is not shielded or moved—the king is said to be in check. The game is won when one king is in check and cannot avoid capture
     on the next move; this is called checkmate. A game also can end when a player, believing the situation to be hopeless, acknowledges 
     defeat by resigning. <br><br>

    There are three possible results in chess: win, lose, or draw. There are six ways a draw can come about: <br><br>
     (1) by mutual consent, <br>(2) when neither player has enough pieces to deliver checkmate,<br> (3) when one player can check the enemy
      king endlessly (perpetual check),<br> (4) when a player who is not in check has no legal move (stalemate),<br> (5) when an identical 
      position occurs three times with the same player having the right to move, <br> (6) when no piece has been captured and no pawn has
       been moved within a period of 50 moves. <br><br>
    
    In competitive events, a victory is scored as one point, a draw as half a point, and a loss as no points.</p>

<button class="collapsible">Moves</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>The board represents a battlefield in which two armies fight to capture each other’s king. A player’s army consists of 16 
    pieces that begin play on the two ranks closest to that player. There are six different types of pieces: king, rook, bishop, queen, 
    knight, and pawn; the pieces are distinguished by appearance and by how they move. The players alternate moves, White going first.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">King<i class="fa-regular fa-chess-king"></i></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>White’s king begins the game on e1. Black’s king is opposite at e8. Each king can move one square in any direction; e.g., White’s 
    king can move from e1 to d1, d2, e2, f2, or f1.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Rook<i class="fa-regular fa-chess-rook"></i></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Each player has two rooks (formerly also known as castles), which begin the game on the corner squares a1 and h1 for White, a8 and 
    h8 for Black. A rook can move vertically or horizontally to any unobstructed square along the file or rank on which it is placed.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Bishop<i class="fa-regular fa-chess-bishop bishop"></i></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Each player has two bishops, and they begin the game at c1 and f1 for White, c8 and f8 for Black. A bishop can move to any unobstructed 
    square on the diagonal on which it is placed. Therefore, each player has one bishop that travels only on light-coloured squares and one 
    bishop that travels only on dark-coloured squares.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Queen<i class="fa-regular fa-chess-queen"></i></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Each player has one queen, which combines the powers of the rook and bishop and is thus the most mobile and powerful piece. The White 
    queen begins at d1, the Black queen at d8.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible" >Knight <i class="fa-regular fa-chess-king"></i></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Each player has two knights, and they begin the game on the squares between their rooks and bishops—i.e., at b1 and g1 for White and 
    b8 and g8 for Black. The knight has the trickiest move, an L-shape of two steps: first one square like a rook, then one square like a 
    bishop, but always in a direction away from the starting square. A knight at e4 could move to f2, g3, g5, f6, d6, c5, c3, or d2. The 
    knight has the unique ability to jump over any other piece to reach its destination. It always moves to a square of a different colour.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Capturing</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>The king, rook, bishop, queen, and knight capture enemy pieces in the same manner that they move. For example, a White queen on d3 
    can capture a Black rook at h7 by moving to h7 and removing the enemy piece from the board. Pieces can capture only enemy pieces.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Pawns</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Each player has eight pawns, which begin the game on the second rank closest to each player; i.e., White’s pawns start at a2, b2, c2,
     and so on, while Black’s pawns start at a7, b7, c7, and so on. The pawns are unique in several ways. A pawn can move only forward; it
      can never retreat. It moves differently than it captures. A pawn moves to the square directly ahead of it but captures on the squares
       diagonally in front of it; e.g., a White pawn at f5 can move to f6 but can capture only on g6 or e6. An unmoved pawn has the option
        of moving one or two squares forward. This is the reason for another peculiar option, called en passant—that is, in 
        passing—available to a pawn when an enemy pawn on an adjoining file advances two squares on its initial move and could have been 
        captured had it moved only one square. The first pawn can take the advancing pawn en passant, as if it had advanced only one square.
         An en passant capture must be made then or not at all. Only pawns can be captured en passant. The last unique feature of the pawn 
         occurs if it reaches the end of a file; it must then be promoted to—that is, exchanged for—a queen, rook, bishop, or knight.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Castling</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>The one exception to the rule that a player may move only one piece at a time is a compound move of king and rook called castling. 
    A player castles by shifting the king two squares in the direction of a rook, which is then placed on the square the king has crossed. 
    For example, White can castle kingside by moving the king from e1 to g1 and the rook from h1 to f1. Castling is permitted only once in 
    a game and is prohibited if the king or rook has previously moved or if any of the squares between them is occupied. Also, castling is 
    not legal if the square the king starts on, crosses, or finishes on is attacked by an enemy piece.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Relative piece values</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Assigning the pawn a value of 1, the values of the other pieces are approximately as follows: knight 3, bishop 3, rook 5, and queen 9.
     The relative values of knights and bishops vary with different pawn structures. Additionally, tactical considerations may temporarily 
     override the pieces’ usual relative values. Material concerns are secondary to winning.</p>
